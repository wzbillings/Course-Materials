# Course-Materials
A repository to hold all of my course materials that I saved.

## Explanation
This repo really has two main purposes.

1. To have a centralized place where I can access all of my course materials that I've saved to GitHub.
2. So I can learn how to use git submodules. Every course will be a submodule of this repository, and will be private unless I have permission to post the course materials. Some of these courses will also have their own submodules üòÅ
